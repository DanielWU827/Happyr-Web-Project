## Meetings
In the interest of student privacy, we will communicate about our meetings in the team group chat.

## Communication
All of our communication will be primarilly through the team group chat, supplemented by email.
## Technologies
All team members are expected to use VSCode and work with files through the team gitHub.
## Decision-Making
The team member who is most familiar with that section of the code will have authority to make decisions. However, if two people have differing ideas about structure, a third teammate may be asked to act as an impartial party and mediate the issue. 
## Delegation
Informal delegations will be handled during team meetings. Everyone will discuss what their current workload is, and what they are interested in doing. This will ensure an equal balance of workload.
## Conflict Resolution
While academic discourse and constructive criticism are highly valued, LADZ has a strict policy against unnecessary negativity. We will first attempt to resolve problems internally, but should any member feel unduly treated, we will involve the professor and ask for advice before proceeding.
