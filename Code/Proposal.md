Authors listed alphabetically; all contributed equally.

## 1 Working Title

FindHappiness.com

## 2 Dataset Summary

We will use the HappyDB dataset, which contains over 100,000 short descrip-
tions of happy moments collected from people. The dataset includes:

- Happy moments text: what made people feel happy.

- Categories: types of happiness, such as family, achievement, leisure, or
    exercise.
    
- Basic demographics: age, gender, and country of the contributors.

This dataset is relevant because it provides many real-life happy stories. We
will use them in my FindHappy website to share positive moments with users
and spread happiness.

## 4 User Interactions

### 4.1 Interaction 1

Potential Users

Sad people might be our target users; they may be looking for something fun to cheer themselves up.

Interaction Mechanism

They can filter and retrieve relevant happy moments based on keywords, or they can search for keywords using the search bar.

Advantage: It can directly match the existing categories in the metadata, and if additional categories are needed, it can match keywords within the text.

Disadvantage: If it only match keywords within the text, the matching may be inaccurate because it cannot analyze the overall content and context of the article.

Potential Benefits

Receiving comfort helps them stop feeling sad.

Potential Harms

It may create a sense of comparison, as others’ happiness can make one feel even sadder about their own misfortune.

### 4.2 Interaction 2

Potential Users

People who can't have in person conversations for medical reasons or otherwise.

Interaction Mechanism

They can be matched randomly by click the "random" button, or just roll the screen to see random matching.

Advantage: Text-only interaction does not require complex interfaces or multimedia support. Random selection also requires less memory.

Disadvantage: There is no visual or audio feedback, which may make the interaction feel dull to users. It is also difficult to convey emotions or intuitive information (for example, images and audio are more vivid).

Potential Benefits

They can once again feel the breath of life, which lifts their spirits, or they may try to recreate the joyful moments mentioned above.

Potential Harms

The same as 4.1.


### 4.3 Interaction 3

Potential Users

People who lack inspiration—for example, a writer who wants to create a happy scene, someone planning a surprise for their family, or a boyfriend hoping to leave his girlfriend with beautiful memories

Interaction Mechanism

They can search for and replicate others’ happy stories, or use external generative AI to create images.

Advantage: Images convey emotions more intuitively.

Disadvantage: Generative AI consumes more memory and needs higher demands on the user’s network and hardware.

Potential Benefits

Create a happy day.

Potential Harms

None. Since it is only an extra form of support, there won’t be any real loss even if it doesn’t work.
